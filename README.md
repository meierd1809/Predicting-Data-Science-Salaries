# Predicting-Data-Science-Salaries

- The purpose of this project was to predict salaries for various jobs in the Data Science field. We focused solely on United States data in this project. 
    
  - This project highlights the following approaches:
    
      1) Identifying a dataset to work with
      2) Cleaning the data
      3) Performing EDA
      4) Performing Feature Engineering
      5) Scaling of Numerical Data
      6) Encoding Categorical Data
      7) Running multiple iterations of Logistics, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, KNN models, which includes hyperparameter tuning, adjustments of the training/test set ratio and adjustments of features
      8) Creating visualizations of the data to tell the story of how our best model performed
