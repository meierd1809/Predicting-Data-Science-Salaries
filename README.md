# Predicting-Data-Science-Salaries

- The purpose of this project was to predict salaries for various jobs in the Data Science field. We focused solely on United States data in this project. 
    
  - This project highlights the following approaches:
    
    - Identifying a dataset to work with
    - Cleaning the data
    - Performing EDA
    - Performing Feature Engineering
    - Scaling of Numerical Data
    - Encoding Categorical Data
    - Running multiple iterations of Logistics, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, KNN models, which includes hyperparameter tuning, adjustments of the training/test set ratio and adjustments of features
    - Creating visualizations of the data to tell the story of how our best model performed
